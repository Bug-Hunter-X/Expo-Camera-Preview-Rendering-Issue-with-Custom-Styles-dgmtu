This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with custom styles.  The camera preview might not render correctly, appearing blank or showing only a portion of the viewfinder.  This is often due to incorrect styling interfering with the Camera's internal layout.  Here's an example of a problematic style:

```javascript
<Camera style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black' }}>
  {/* ... Camera children ... */}
</Camera>
```

The `backgroundColor` style, while seemingly harmless, can sometimes conflict with how Expo renders the camera preview.  Other styles such as `position` or `flex` properties might cause similar issues.
