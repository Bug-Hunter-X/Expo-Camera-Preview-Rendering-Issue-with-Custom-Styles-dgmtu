# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo `Camera` component where custom styles can prevent the camera preview from rendering correctly.  The issue is particularly noticeable when applying background colors or manipulating flexbox properties. 

## Bug Description

The camera preview may appear blank or partially obscured when certain styles are applied to the `<Camera>` component. This is likely due to a conflict between the custom styles and the internal layout of the Camera component.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing and adjusting the styles applied to the `<Camera>` component.  Avoid overly complex styling and instead focus on styles that don't interfere with the Camera's internal rendering mechanism. 

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
4. Observe the faulty rendering in `bug.js` and the corrected rendering in `bugSolution.js`.
