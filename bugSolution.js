The solution is to avoid directly styling the `Camera` component with styles that might interfere with its internal rendering.  Instead, wrap the `Camera` in a parent view and apply the styles to the parent. This isolates the camera from potentially conflicting styles:

```javascript
<View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black' }}>
  <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    {/* ... Camera children ... */}
  </Camera>
</View>
```

This ensures that the background color applies to the parent view without affecting the Camera's internal rendering process.  Also, thoroughly check other styles that are applied to make sure none of them conflict with the camera's layout.
